//2. Count the number of trailing 0s(number of 0s at the end of the number) in a factorial number.Input: 5
//Output : 1, Input : 10 Output : 2

//Works by creating a function to return the trailing 0's of whatever n is.
//Will divide whatever the input of n is by the power of 5, and will then return sum.
//The main function will call the value n once a number has been input by the user from function TZ.

		sum = sum + n / i;
