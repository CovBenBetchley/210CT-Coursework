Question 5

Write the pseudocode corresponding to functions for addition, subtraction and
multiplication of two matrices, and then compute A=B*C –2*(B+C), where B and C are two
quadratic matrices of order n. What is the run-time?

Pseudocode for A=B*C –2*(B+C)


A1 <- ADDITION_MATRIX (B+C)
	MATRIX <- []
	FOR a IN range(LENGTH_MATRIX [X])
		ADD [] TO MATRIX
		FOR b IN range(LENGTH_MATRIX [Y])
			ADD X[a][b] + Y[a][b] TO MATRIX[i]

Big O Notation = O(N*N)

	

A2 <- MULTIPLICATION_MATRIX (B*C)
	MATRIX <- []
	FOR a IN range(LENGTH_MATRIX [X])
	ADD [] TO MATRIX
		FOR b IN range(LENGTH_MATRIX [Y])
			ADD 0 TO MATRIX[a]
			FOR c IN range(LENGTH_MATRIX [Y])	
				MATRIX <- MATRIX + (X[a][c] - Y[c][b]

Big O Notation = O(N*N*N)


A <- SUBTRACTION_MATRIX (A2-A1)
	MATRIX <- []
	FOR a IN range(LENGTH_MATRIX [X])
		ADD [] TO MATRIX
		FOR b IN range(LENGTH_MATRIX [Y])
			ADD X[a][b] - Y[a][b] TO MATRIX[i]

Big O Notation = O(N*N)
