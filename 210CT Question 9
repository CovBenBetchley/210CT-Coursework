//9. Adapt the binary search algorithm so that instead of outputting whether a specific value
//was found, it outputs whether a value within an interval(specified by you) was found.

//The idea of this algorithm is to us the binary search algorithm to determine if there is a value in an array
//between a low and a high value inputted by the user. The search works by finding the middle element, and checks
//whether the value is in the first or last set of elements from the middle. If found, the half without the element
//is discarded and the operation loops through until the element is found (end <= start).

//Function binarySearch is created, taking 3 integer values, low being the low value, and high being the high
//value. Also integer a that stores the value using a pointer.

bool binarySearch(int *a, int high, int low)

//until end is equal or smaller than 0. The while loop finds the middle of the array.

		else if (a[middle]  > high)
			end = middle - 1;
//else make start(0) the middle value plus 1.
